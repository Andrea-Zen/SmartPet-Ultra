SmartPaw 360: The Ultimate Pet Care Companion
SmartPaw 360 is a cutting-edge, Arduino-powered device designed to enhance your pet's well-being while providing you with convenience and peace of mind. With features like automated feeding, interactive laser play, environmental monitoring, and remote control capabilities, this project is your petâ€™s new best friend.

Features
Automated Feeding System
Dispenses food on schedule or on demand, ensuring your pet is always well-fed.

Interactive Laser Play
Keeps your pet entertained with a dynamic laser toy that moves in random patterns.

Environmental Monitoring
Monitors temperature and humidity in real-time to ensure your pet's comfort.

LED Lighting
Color-coded lights reflect temperature levels, adding a fun and informative visual touch.

Sound and Motion Detection
Detects your pet's activity or vocalizations to adapt responses, such as activating the laser or notifying you.

Low Food Warning System
Alerts you when the food supply is running low with sound effects and LED notifications.

Remote Control
Bluetooth functionality enables you to control the system via a smartphone app.

Data Logging and Memory
Saves temperature, humidity, and feeding logs to EEPROM for long-term monitoring.

Battery Monitoring
Alerts you when the device's battery is low.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno or Mega
Servo Motors (x2)
Adafruit NeoPixel RGB LED
DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
HX711 Load Cell Amplifier and Weight Sensor
Motion Sensor (PIR)
Sound Sensor Module
Laser Module
Bluetooth Module (HC-05 or similar)
Buzzer
Battery Monitoring Module
Pet Food Dispenser
Miscellaneous: Wires, resistors, breadboard, and a suitable power source
Setup Instructions
Hardware Assembly

Connect all sensors, modules, and components according to the circuit diagram provided in the project repository.
Attach the servo motor to the food dispenser.
Mount the laser module on two servos for dynamic movement.
Software Upload

Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Add the necessary libraries:
Servo
Adafruit_NeoPixel
HX711
DHT
EEPROM
Upload the SmartPaw360.ino file to your Arduino board.
Testing the System

Power on the device.
Monitor the Serial Monitor for sensor readings and status updates.
Test each feature individually, such as feeding, laser play, and motion detection.
Usage
Feeding: Press the physical button or use the smartphone app to dispense food. The system will also auto-dispense at set intervals.
Laser Play: The laser activates when motion is detected or through manual control.
Status Monitoring: Observe temperature, humidity, and food levels on the Serial Monitor or via LED indicators.
Remote Control: Use the app to activate features or check statuses.
How It Works
Automated Feeding
The weight sensor ensures the correct amount of food is dispensed. A servo motor opens and closes the dispenser.

Laser Play
Two servos move the laser in random patterns, triggered by motion or controlled remotely.

Environmental Monitoring
The DHT22 sensor measures temperature and humidity, with results displayed via LEDs and the Serial Monitor.

Notifications
The buzzer and LEDs provide audio and visual alerts for events like low food levels or battery warnings.

Future Improvements
WiFi integration for cloud-based monitoring.
Camera module for live pet streaming.
Advanced AI to track your pet's behavior and needs.
